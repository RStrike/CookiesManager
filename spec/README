= CookiesManager Specs

== Running the specs

1. Run the +bundle+ command to install the necessary gems
2. Run the +rake+ command to run all the specs

  bundle
  rake

Some of the specs, covering race conditions in multithreaded contexts, pause in purpose some threads for a few seconds through AOP to test critical sections. Those "slow" tests can be easily skipped by passing +skip_slow+ as an argument to the +rake+ command:

  rake skip_slow

However, I recommend running all the specs whenever you change the code.

== Ruby versions

Currently, the specs require Ruby 1.8.7.

Ruby 1.9.x support is coming up next.
